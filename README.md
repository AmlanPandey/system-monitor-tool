# System Monitor Tool

## 1. Overview
The **System Monitor Tool** is a simple Linux-based project written in **C++** that displays real-time system information such as CPU usage, memory usage, and active processes.  
It works inside the **terminal** using the **ncurses** library, similar to the `top` command in Linux.  

This project was created as part of a learning objective to understand process handling, system calls, and terminal UI programming in C++.
